Schemas - 

1. Customer (Name, DOB, Username, Password, Email, PhoneNumber)
2. Seller (SellerId, SellerName)
2. Product (ProductID, ProductName, Description, SellerId, Price, Category)
3. Order (OrderID, Username, ProductID, OrderDate)
4. Cart (Username, ProductID, Quantity)

User and Product are going to be defined in RDS, while Order and Cart are in DynamoDB.

For each microservice ...
Write the business logic (Node.js).
Create a Lambda function.
Define its data store (DynamoDB table or RDS schema).
Use API Gateway to create a REST endpoint (/users, /products, /cart, /orders).
Use Secrets Manager for any API keys (e.g., Stripe, SendGrid).

So the structure goes like:
service/
    model/
    routes/
    main.js

Still need plans on how to do:
1. API Gateway
2. Email and notification service
3. Infrastructure as Code
4. Payment service

Final list of microservices -
Customer Service, Product Catalog Service, Shopping Cart Service, Order Service, Notification Service and Payment Service
